Fatal police shooting has always been a problem in the United States. When police have guns, they inevitablely use it under certain scenerios. The plot above shows the trends of fatal police shootings in the past 5 years (starting in 2015). The shooting counts both justified and unjustified cases. Several famous unjustified fatal police shootings are annotated on the plot. Evidently, there are no clear increasing or decreasing trends of fatal police shootings, but the topic popularity online has skyrocketed after each of the major unjustified shootings.</p><h4 id="google-search-trend-of-keyward:-“fatal-police-shooting”">Google Search Trend of Keyward: “Fatal Police Shooting”</h4><p><img src="static/images/search_trend.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/>
Two peaks in hot search is evident from the google data. One followed after the death of Walter Scott, and the other peak follows George Floyd’s death. Recently you may have felt the prevalence of fatal police shooting is higher than ever, but from the two plots above, we see no correlation between total fatal police shootings and search trends. Our perception of the fatal police shooting may be directed by the amount of news articles circulating the internet.</p><h2 id="-">-</h2><h3 id="which-states-sees-the-most-fatal-police-shootings?">Which States Sees the Most Fatal Police Shootings?</h3><p>Another problem we may ignore by looking at the national news websites is that fatal police shootings may be local problems. Often when we see something viral online, we want to think the event happened close to us and we begin to worry. But from the map below, we see that fatal police shootings are much denser in states like California and Texas compared to Nevada and Oregon.</p><p><img src="static/images/shooting_map.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/>
To emphasize on the distribution of fatal police shootings counts across the different states, the treemap below is a better visualization that allows you to compare between the sizes of each box (corresponding to a state). The larger the box, the higher the count of death due to police shootings.</p><img src="static/images/shooting_treemap.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/><h3 id="age:">Age:</h3><img src="static/images/age.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/><h3 id="race:">Race:</h3><h3 id="insights-and-discussions">Insights and Discussions</h3><h3 id="data-source">Data Source</h3><p><span>Link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/data-police-shootings">https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/data-police-shootings</a>
